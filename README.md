# Amphetamine Icons

Amphetamine is a colorful, vibrant, *energetic* icon pack based on material design, but with several improvements.

This icon pack is my take on material design, not too far off from the official guidelines, but enough to satisfy my own tastes.

# Features:
- 1400+ icons
- Several alternative icons for nearly every app
- 45+ wallpapers
- Seamless Icon requests with a single tap
- Auto apply.

# About

Amphetamine is built on top of the open source icon pack dashboard, [Blueprint][blueprint-url], developed by [Jahir Fiquitiva][jahir-url]. The modifications that I have made to the library code of the Blueprint dashboard are in no way endorsed by the original author of the dashboard. See `LICENSE.md`.

The modifications that I have made include: 
- using my own api server for collection icon request data
- changing some string values
