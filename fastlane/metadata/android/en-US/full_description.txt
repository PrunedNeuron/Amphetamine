Note: Amphetamine is now <a href="https://git.io/amphetamineicons">open source</a>!

Amphetamine is a colorful, vibrant, <i>energetic</i> icon pack based on material design, but with several improvements.

This icon pack is my take on material design, not too far off from the official guidelines, but enough to satisfy my own tastes. These are the kind of icons that I would prefer. Feel free to <a href="mailto:am@ayushm.dev">send</a> me suggestions if you have any.

<b>Features</b>
• 1400+ icons
• Several alternative icons for nearly every app
• 45+ wallpapers
• Seamless Icon requests with a single tap
• Auto apply


I no longer take premium icon requests, since it would be unfair to prioritize my tasks based on who paid the most. In fact, I have modified the icon requests system to not contain the user's name or other identifying data, so that all icon requests are considered equal. 

I prioritize based on how many requests I have received for each app. The apps which are more popular will get themed before the rest. However, if I have an especially good idea for a regular app, I might make an icon for that instead.

<b>FAQs</b>

<b> What happened to premium requests? </b>
Due to time limitations, the premium request feature has been removed. Also, I realized that it was unfair to prioritize some requests rather than to treat them all equally. All users now have the ability to send 10 icon requests per week.

<b> Will my icon request be part of the next update? </b>
I get tens of requests everyday, and I try my best to make icons for all of them. However, I prioritize the apps that are requested the most by multiple users. Although I cannot guarantee your request will be part of the next update, I'll try my best.

<b>About the application</b>:
Amphetamine uses a slightly modified version of the open source <a href="https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint">Blueprint dashboard</a> by <a href="https://jahir.dev/">Jahir Fiquitiva</a>. The changes I have made to the source are minimal with a single feature change - the way icon requests are sent. The modification involves communicating with an API that I made to make managing icon requests easier for me and the process of sending me an icon request, easier for the user.
